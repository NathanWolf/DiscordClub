         `<p>`I can't actually chat with you, sorry.
         `<p>`Maybe one day I'll be sentient?
         `<p>`For now, you can just ask me some questions about Magic.

         `<p>`elMakers is an almost-real company that has existed since before Minecraft
         `<p>`It was originally created as a communal crafting company
         `<p>`And so the name was a sort-of inside joke, meaning "The Makers"
         `<p>`But kind-of in Spanish ;)
         `<p>`Now it pretty much just exists as an umbrella for all of NathanWolf's Minecraft creations.
